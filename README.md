# ExpandableDelegates
more convenient way to add multiple delegates to your expandable recyclerView! 

```groovy
new ExpandableBuilder(this)
                .withAdapter(createAdapter())
                .withRecyclerView(recyclerView)
                .build();
```
#Usage

Look at master branch. Code at MainActivity.class will help you.
